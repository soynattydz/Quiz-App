Quiz question ideas
// age preferences, location preferences, interest preferences 
        // Will these be rigid or just for a more initial personalised app experience? 
        // People can choose to skip this feature 
Frontend app quiz component features, options for user to choose from, include a 'I don't mind answer' 
// "Do you have an age preference?" Yes -> Give age brackets or option to fill out ages themselves "No, I don't mind" -> take to next question 
API endpoint = backend server to receive quiz responses from the frontend which will store the user's responses in the database.
Implement logic
// Personalised recommendations based on above upon finishing if quiz app not skipped 
Display results 
// Either personalised or extremely open where they can then narrow down the searches
